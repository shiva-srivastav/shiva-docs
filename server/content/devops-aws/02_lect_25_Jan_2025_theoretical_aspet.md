### DevOps

**Definition:** DevOps combines development and operations, focusing on simplifying application delivery processes in IT industries to achieve higher quality and efficiency. It promotes collaboration between Development and Operations teams.

#### Roles of Development Team:
1. Requirement Gathering.
2. Requirement Analysis.
3. Design.
4. Actual Development (Coding).
5. Unit Testing.
6. Code Integration.
7. Testing.
8. Bug Fixing.

#### Roles of DevOps Team:
1. Understanding infrastructure requirements:
   - Server, Storage, Backup, Network, Security.
2. Infrastructure creation in the cloud using:
   - AWS, Azure, GCP (via Terraform).
3. Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible).
4. Working with Linux machines.
5. Repository management:
   - GitHub, Bitbucket.
6. Containerization with Docker:
   - Application code and dependencies.
7. Orchestration with Kubernetes.
8. Automating builds and deployments using Jenkins (CI/CD pipelines).
9. Infrastructure and application monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

**Models:**
1. Waterfall Model.
2. Agile Model.
3. Scrum Framework.
4. JIRA Tool.

### Application Architecture

- **Components:**
  - Frontend (UI/Presentation).
  - Backend (Business Logic).
  - Database (Storage).
- **Frontend Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular.
- **Backend Tools:** Java (Spring), JavaScript (Node.js), C# (.NET), Python (Django).
- **Database Storage:** Cassandra, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB.

**Common Tech Stacks:**
1. Angular + Java + MySQL.
2. Angular + Python + MongoDB.
3. React + .NET + SQL Server.
4. React + Java + Oracle.
5. React + Node.js + MongoDB.

### Cloud Computing (AWS)

**Key Features:**
1. Virtual Machines (EC2):
   - Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, Block Storage.
2. Unlimited Storage (S3).
3. Relational Database (RDS).
4. IAM (Users and Group Management).
5. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
6. Kubernetes Cluster.
7. Domain Mapping (Route 53).
8. Monitoring Tools (CloudWatch).
9. SNS (Simple Notification Service).

### Types of Software Projects

1. **Standalone/Desktop Applications:** Single-user applications (e.g., Calculator, Notepad).
2. **Web Applications:** Multi-user platforms (e.g., Telusko, Amazon, Facebook).
3. **Distributed Enterprise Applications:** B2B systems (e.g., Razorpay, PayPal).
4. **Mobile Applications:** Apps like WhatsApp, Instagram.

---

### Architectural Patterns

1. **Monolithic Architecture:** All functionalities in one application (everything in one place).
2. **Microservices Architecture:** Developing functionalities as independent services (modules interconnected via endpoints).

**Diagram: Monolithic vs Microservices**
```
[Monolithic]:
   [UI] --> [Backend] --> [Database]

[Microservices]:
   [UI] --> [Service A] --> [Database A]
         --> [Service B] --> [Database B]
         --> [Service C] --> [Database C]
```

---

### DevOps Tools

1. Terraform (Infrastructure creation).
2. Ansible (Configuration management).
3. Maven/Gradle (Build tools).
4. GitHub (Repository management).
5. Tomcat (Webserver).
6. SonarQube (Code review).
7. Nexus (Repository management).
8. Docker (Containerization).
9. Kubernetes (Orchestration).
10. Jenkins (CI/CD).
11. Prometheus and Grafana (Monitoring tools).
12. Application log monitoring tools.
